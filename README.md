   - Execute the script in PowerShell, providing the necessary parameters (source disk name, resource groups, target region, tenant ID, and subscription ID).

## Script Components

### Functions

1. **`Copy_AzDiskToDifferentRegion`**:
   - Handles the core functionality of copying a disk from one Azure region to another.

2. **`Install-AzCopy`**:
   - Ensures the AzCopy utility is installed and available for disk copying operations.

### Process Flow

1. **Module Installation Check**: Verifies and installs required Azure PowerShell modules.
2. **AzCopy Check and Installation**: Ensures AzCopy is installed for disk copying.
3. **Azure Connection**: Connects to the Azure tenant and sets the Azure context.
4. **Disk Retrieval and Configuration**: Retrieves the source disk and configures the target disk.
5. **Security Profile Handling**: Copies the security profile from the source disk to the target disk if available.
6. **SAS Token Generation**: Generates Shared Access Signature (SAS) tokens for both the source and target disks.
7. **Disk Copying**: Uses AzCopy to transfer the disk data from the source to the target.
8. **Cleanup**: Revokes the SAS tokens post-copy.

### Error Handling

- The script includes try-catch blocks to gracefully handle errors at each critical step.
- Provides descriptive error messages to aid in troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

This PowerShell script is an essential tool for Azure administrators and engineers. It automates the process of copying Azure Managed Disks across different regions, ensuring a smooth and efficient data transfer experience.

## Additional Notes
